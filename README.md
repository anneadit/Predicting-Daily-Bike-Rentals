# Predicting-Daily-Bike-Rentals
Using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning methods to predict the number of daily bike rentals in Washington D.C. 

I created this notebook to demonstrate the various regression models in machine learning and compare how they perform on this particular dataset.

We will first train a simple Linear Regression model and then compared its results with a Decision Tree, a Random Forest, and a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree. We will also use the grid search technique to try the find the optimal hyperparameters for the Decision Tree and Random Forest.
